# MetaCrafter-JavaScript
# Student NFT Simulator

## Problem Statement

The objective of this project is to simulate the minting and management of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). Each NFT represents a unique student with specific metadata such as name, course, unique ID, and CGPA. The aim is to create a simple yet effective system to mint new NFTs, list all minted NFTs, and get the total number of NFTs created.

## Description

This project is implemented in JavaScript and provides a set of functions to manage student NFTs. The code allows you to:
- Mint new student NFTs with specific metadata.
- List all minted student NFTs along with their metadata.
- Get the total number of student NFTs created.

### Features

- *Minting NFTs*: The mintNFT function allows you to create a new NFT for a student by providing their name, course, unique ID, and CGPA.
- *Listing NFTs*: The listNFTs function iterates through all minted NFTs and prints their details to the console.
- *Total Supply*: The getTotalSupply function returns the total number of NFTs created.

### Technologies Used

- JavaScript: The primary programming language used for the implementation.
